<h1>MS Office 365 - AdminCenter /Outlook</h1>

<p> During my 90 days trial with E5 tenant Microsoft developer program, I took my time to get familiar handling Office 365 administration. 
I learned to created a custom rule, ran some simple commands, and added to the user to the departmnet group.</p>

<p>When I run this command, it limits other features such as COM Add-ins and extension, custom toolbards and ribbon changes, reading pane
and bypasses certain settings.</p>
